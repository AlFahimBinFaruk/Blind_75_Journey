### Intro to Greedy.
* Greedy Algorithm - an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving approach of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
  * pros - simple,easy to implement,run fast
  * cons - very often don't provide globally optimum solution.

* when to use?
  * Greedy - choice property : a global optimum can be arrived at by selecting local optimum.
  * Optimal substructure : An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.
